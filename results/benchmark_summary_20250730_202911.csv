A) bank
B) library
C) department store

E) new york

Let's think step by step.","The question asks where a revolving door serves as a security measure. Let's consider each option:

*   **A) bank:** Banks deal with money and valuables, making security a top priority. Revolving doors in banks can serve as a security measure by:
    *   **Controlling entry/exit:** They limit the number of people who can enter or exit at one time, making it harder for a group to rush in or out during a robbery.
    *   **""Man trap"" function:** Some high-security revolving doors can lock a person inside if a security breach is detected, preventing them from entering further or escaping.
    *   **Deterring quick getaways:** The design makes it difficult for a large number of people to quickly flee.
    *   **Integrating with security checks:** They can be designed to allow only one person through at a time, facilitating individual security checks (e.g., metal detectors).

*   **B) library:** While libraries need security against theft of books, a revolving door isn't typically a primary security measure against high-level threats like robbery. Its main purpose would be climate control or traffic flow.

*   **C) department store:** Similar to libraries, department stores focus on preventing shoplifting, but a revolving door's primary role would be climate control and managing customer flow, not as a major security barrier against violent crime.

*   **D) mall:** Malls are large public spaces. Revolving doors are used for climate control and convenience, not typically as a core security measure against crime in the way a bank would use them.

*   **E) new york:** New York is a city, not a type of establishment where a revolving door would be installed. This option is irrelevant.

Considering the options, a **bank** is the place where a revolving door most prominently serves as a security measure, beyond just convenience or climate control.

Let's think step by step.","Let's break down each option:

*   **A) complete job:** This is the most fundamental and universal aim. People are hired to perform specific tasks and achieve certain outcomes, which collectively constitute ""completing their job."" This is why they get paid and why the organization exists.
*   **B) learn from each other:** While learning is a valuable and often encouraged aspect of work, it's usually a *secondary aim* or a *means to an end* (to better complete the job or advance one's career), rather than the primary reason people go to work.
*   **C) kill animals:** This is only relevant to a tiny fraction of jobs (e.g., pest control, specific agricultural roles) and is not a general aim for people at work.
*   **D) wear hats:** Wearing hats might be a requirement for some jobs (e.g., safety, hygiene, uniform), but it's never the *aim* of the work itself.
*   **E) talk to each other:** Communication is crucial for collaboration and getting work done, but talking is a *tool* or a *social aspect*, not the primary *aim* of work. People talk *in order to* complete their job.

**Step-by-step thinking:**

1.  **Identify the core purpose of employment:** Why do people have jobs? To perform tasks and contribute to an organization's goals.
2.  **Evaluate options against this core purpose:**
    *   ""Complete job"" directly aligns with this.
    *   ""Learn from each other"" is beneficial but not the *primary* reason for employment.
    *   ""Kill animals"" is highly specific and not general.
    *   ""Wear hats"" is a superficial action, not a work aim.
    *   ""Talk to each other"" is a means, not an end.
