Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces","The answer to whether ethanol takes more energy to make than it produces depends on the source material:

*   **Corn Ethanol (US):** Based on the provided text, it generally takes more energy to make than it produces, or at best, a very modest net gain. The text states ""one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol"" and ""corn, which only returns about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended."" This indicates a very small net gain, or even a net loss if you consider all energy inputs beyond just fossil fuels.

*   **Sugarcane Ethanol (Brazil):** The text indicates that sugarcane ethanol is much more energy-efficient. It states ""one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol"" and ""returns from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended."" This shows a significant net energy gain.

**In summary:**

*   **Corn ethanol:** Generally produces only slightly more energy than it consumes, or is close to a net loss.
*   **Sugarcane ethanol:** Produces significantly more energy than it consumes.

The text also highlights that ""Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory."" However, based *solely* on the figures provided in this text, sugarcane ethanol is a much more energy-efficient fuel source than corn ethanol.",The final answer is: (provide only yes or no),No,no,no,True,2080,,0,0.0,3,15,30

Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces

Let's think step by step.","The question ""does ethanol take more energy make that produces"" is a bit grammatically challenging, but it seems to be asking: **Does it take more energy to produce ethanol than the energy it yields when burned?**

Based on the provided text, the answer is: **It depends on the source of the ethanol.**

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Corn Ethanol (US):** The text states that ""one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 1.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol."" This means that **corn ethanol produces more energy than it takes to make it (1.3 units out for 1 unit in)**. However, the return is modest. Another survey gives a similar figure of ""about 1.34 units of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended.""

*   **Sugarcane Ethanol (Brazil):** The text indicates a much more favorable energy balance: ""one unit of fossil-fuel energy required to create 8 from the ethanol."" Another survey reports ""from 8 to 9 units of energy for each unit expended."" This means **sugarcane ethanol produces significantly more energy than it takes to make it.**

**In summary:**

*   **No, ethanol generally does not take more energy to make than it produces.**
*   **Both corn and sugarcane ethanol show a positive energy balance (they produce more energy than is invested).**
*   **Sugarcane ethanol has a much better energy balance than corn ethanol.**

The text also highlights that ""Energy balance estimates are not easily produced, thus numerous such reports have been generated that are contradictory."" This means there's ongoing debate and varying figures, but the general consensus from these specific reports is a positive energy balance for both, with sugarcane being superior.",The final answer is: (provide only yes or no),No,no,no,True,5630,,0,0.0,3,15,30
