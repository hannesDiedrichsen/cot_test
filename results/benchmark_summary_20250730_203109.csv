No, ethanol generally **produces more energy than it takes to make**, according to the energy balance figures cited.

*   For **corn ethanol** produced in the US, one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create **1.3 to 1.34 energy units** from the resulting ethanol. This means it produces slightly more energy than it consumes.
*   For **sugarcane ethanol** produced in Brazil, one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create **8 to 9 energy units** from the ethanol. This indicates a much more favorable energy balance, producing significantly more energy than it consumes.

Question: does ethanol take more energy make that produces

Let's think step by step.","Based on the figures provided in the text, **no, ethanol does not take more energy to make than it produces.**

Here's what the text states:

*   **Corn Ethanol (US):**
    *   A 2007 National Geographic report indicates that 1 unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create **1.3 energy units** from the resulting ethanol.
    *   A separate survey reports that corn ethanol returns about **1.34 units** of fuel energy for each unit of energy expended.
    *   In both cases, the energy output (1.3 or 1.34 units) is greater than the energy input (1 unit).

*   **Sugarcane Ethanol (Brazil):**
    *   The 2007 National Geographic report states that 1 unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create **8 energy units** from the ethanol.
    *   A separate survey reports that sugarcane ethanol returns from **8 to 9 units** of energy for each unit expended.
    *   In both cases, the energy output (8 or 8-9 units) is significantly greater than the energy input (1 unit).

Let's think step by step.","The question asks where a revolving door serves as a security measure. Let's consider each option:

*   **A) bank:** Banks deal with money and valuables, making security a top priority. Revolving doors in banks can serve as a security measure by:
    *   **Controlling entry/exit:** They limit the number of people who can enter or exit at one time, making it harder for a group to rush in or out during a robbery.
    *   **""Man trap"" function:** Some high-security revolving doors can lock a person inside if a security breach is detected, preventing them from entering further or escaping.
    *   **Deterring quick getaways:** The design makes it difficult for a large number of people to quickly flee.
    *   **Integrating with security checks:** They can be designed to allow only one person through at a time, facilitating individual security checks (e.g., metal detectors).

*   **B) library:** While libraries need security against theft of books, a revolving door isn't typically a primary security measure against high-level threats like robbery. Its main purpose would be climate control or traffic flow.

*   **C) department store:** Similar to libraries, department stores focus on preventing shoplifting, but a revolving door's primary role would be climate control and managing customer flow, not as a major security barrier against violent crime.

*   **D) mall:** Malls are large public spaces. Revolving doors are used for climate control and convenience, not typically as a core security measure against crime in the way a bank would use them.

*   **E) new york:** New York is a city, not a type of establishment where a revolving door would be installed. This option is irrelevant.

Considering the options, a **bank** is the place where a revolving door most prominently serves as a security measure, beyond just convenience or climate control.
